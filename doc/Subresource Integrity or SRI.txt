Added md5 hashes, https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/477847-fix-uri-and-links
used: openssl dgst -md5 "filepath"
Firstly it was wrong, probably becasue links were on my site where links breaks when not accessed from browser.

Then later removed hashes, as Greasy Fork refused my script, as it's "empty".
All code must be in one script, they say.
